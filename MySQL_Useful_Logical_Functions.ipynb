    "# MySQL Exercise 10: Useful Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few more logical operators we haven't covered yet that you might find useful when designing your queries.  Expressions that use logical operators return a result of \"true\" or \"false\", depending on whether the conditions you specify are met.  The \"true\" or \"false\" results are usually used to determine which, if any, subsequent parts of your query will be run.  We will discuss the IF operator, the CASE operator, and the order of operations within logical expressions in this lesson.\n",

    "IF([your conditions],[value outputted if conditions are met],[value outputted if conditions are NOT met])\n",

    "FROM users\n",
    "```  \n",
    "to output one column that provided the time stamp of when a user account was created, and a second column called user_type that used that time stamp to determine whether the user was an early or late user. User_type could then be used in a GROUP BY statement to segment summary calculations (in database systems that support the use of aliases in GROUP BY statements). \n",
    "   \n",
    "For example, since we know there are duplicate user_guids in the user table, we could combine a subquery with an IF statement to retrieve a list of unique user_guids with their classification as either an early or late user (based on when their first user entry was created): \n",
