    "# MySQL Exercise 11: Queries that Test Relationships Between Test Completion and Dog Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson we are going to integrate all the SQL syntax we've learned so far to start addressing questions in our Dognition Analysis Plan.  I summarized the reasons having an analysis plan is so important in the \"Start with an Analysis Plan\" video accompanying this week's materials.  Analysis plans ensure that you will address questions that are relevant to your business objectives as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The quickest way to narrow in the factors in your analysis plan that are likely to create new insights is to combine simple SQL calculations with visualization programs, like Tableau, to identify which factors under consideration have the strongest effects on the business metric you are tasked with improving.  You can then design more nuanced statistical models in other software, such as R, based on the factors you have confirmed are likely to be important for understanding and changing your business metric. \n",

    "\n",
    "I describe a method for designing analysis plans in the Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau course earlier in this Specialization.  I call that method Structured Pyramid Analysis Plans, or \"sPAPs\".  I have provided a skeleton of an sPAP for the Dognition data set with the materials for this course that I will use as a road map for the queries we will design and practice in the next two lessons.  To orient you, the SMART goal of the analysis project is at the top of the pyramid.  This is a specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound version of the general project objective, which is to make a recommendation to Dognition about what they could do to increase the number of tests customers complete. The variables you will use to assess the goal should be filled out right under where the SMART goal is written.  Then under those variables, you will see ever-widening layers of categories and sub-categories of issues that will be important to analyze in order to achieve your SMART goal.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "In this lesson, we will write queries to address the issues in the left-most branch of the sPAP.  These issues all relate to \"Features of Dogs\" that could potentially influence the number of tests the dogs will ultimately complete.  We will spend a lot of time discussing and practicing how to translate analysis questions described in words into queries written in SQL syntax.\n",

    "## 1. Assess whether Dognition personality dimensions are related to the number of tests completed \n",
    "\n",
    "The first variable in the Dognition sPAP we want to investigate is Dognition personality dimensions.  Recall from the \"Meet Your Dognition Data\" video and the written description of the Dognition Data Set included with the Week 2 materials that Dognition personality dimensions represent distinct combinations of characteristics assessed by the Dognition tests.  It is certainly plausible that certain personalities of dogs might be more or less likely to complete tests.  For example, \"einstein\" dogs might be particularly likely to complete a lot of tests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To test the relationship between Dognition personality dimensions and test completion totals, we need a query that will output a summary of the number of tests completed by dogs that have each of the Dognition personality dimensions.  The features you will need to include in your query are foreshadowed by key words in this sentence.  First, the fact that you need a summary of the number of tests completed suggests you will need an aggregation function.  Next, the fact that you want a different summary for each personality dimension suggests that you will need a GROUP BY clause.  Third, the fact that you need a \"summary of the number of tests completed\" rather than just a \"summary of the tests completed\" suggests that you might have to have multiple stages of aggegrations, which in turn might mean that you will need to use a subquery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build the query step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1: To get a feeling for what kind of values exist in the Dognition personality dimension column, write a query that will output all of the distinct values in the dimension column.  Use your relational schema or the course materials to determine what table the dimension column is in.  Your output should have 11 rows.**\n"

A clause that says you should only include values that are not equal to 1 would remove the rows that have NULL values in the exclude column, because NULL values are never included in equals statements (as we learned in the join lessons).

Ignoring them for now, Herding and Sporting breed_groups complete the most tests, while Toy breed groups complete the least tests.  This suggests that one avenue an analyst might want to explore further is whether it is worth it to target marketing or certain types of Dognition tests to dog owners with dogs in the Herding and Sporting breed_groups.  Later in this lesson we will discuss whether using a median instead of an average to summarize the number of completed tests might affect this potential course of action. \n",

    "These results suggest that although a dog's breed_type doesn't seem to have a strong relationship with how many tests a dog completed, neutered dogs, on average, seem to finish 1-2 more tests than non-neutered dogs.  It may be fruitful to explore further whether this effect is consistent across different segments of dogs broken up according to other variables.  If the effects are consistent, the next step would be to seek evidence that could clarify whether neutered dogs are finishing more tests due to traits that arise when a dog is neutered, or instead, whether owners who are more likely to neuter their dogs have traits that make it more likely they will want to complete more tests.\n",

Examing the relationship between the speed of game completion and number of games completed is best achieved through creating a scatter plot with a best fit line and/or running a statistical regression analysis.  It is possible to achieve the statistical regression analysis through very advanced SQL queries, but the strategy that would be required is outside the scope of this course.  Therefore, I would recommend exporting relevant data to a program like Tableau, R, or Matlab in order to assess the relationship between the speed of game completion and number of games completed.  \n",

Unfortunately, medians are more computationally intensive than averages, and there is no pre-made function that allows you to calculate medians using SQL.  If you wanted to calculate the median, you would need to use an advanced strategy such as the ones described here:\n",

As described in the first video (http://www.statisticslectures.com/topics/outliereffects/), strong outliers lead to large standard deviation values.  Fortunately, we *CAN* calculate standard deviations in SQL easily using the STDDEV function.  Therefore, it is good practice to include standard deviation columns with your outputs so that you have an idea whether the average values outputted by your queries are trustworthy.  Whenever standard deviations are a significant portion of the average values of a field, and certainly when standard deviations are larger than the average values of a field, it's a good idea to export your data to a program that can handle more sophisticated statistical analyses before you interpret any results too strongly.  \n",
